## MolGL®: Contributing Guidelines
<i>Scalable molecular visualisation with WebGL.</i>

Although MolGL® is <i>funded and maintained</i> by Sequømics Corporation — http://sequomics.com/, it’s also a community effort. Whether it’s bug fixing, feature development, or contributions to the ecosystem; scientist, designers and developers from all over the world can help making of MolGL® — A scalable molecular visualisation with WebGL, the most advanced and feature oriented molecular visualization software system in the world.

A select group of our contributors have been dubbed *Codenauts*. They have direct write access to the codebase and support the core MolGL® team on the development of the framework. Are you interested in making your mark on the MolGL® and it's framework? Whether you’re just submitting bugs or helping us write new features, there are many ways to contribute to MolGL®.

## Terms

- The **community** is anyone commenting on issues or opening pull requests. That includes you!
- A **Codenauts** is anyone with write access to the repository.
- The **Core Team** is anyone on the Administrator Team.

## Issues

Open an issue for any problem you have with the framework. If there's anything missing from your issue, such as extra context, a code sample, etc. a team member will ask for more info in the comments.

Support requests are generally better suited for the MolGL® Forum, while GitHub is more appropriate for bugs. If you aren’t sure if your issue is a bug or not, don’t worry! Post your problem on GitHub and the team will help you along. Every participant is expected to follow the project's Code of Conduct so please be courteous and respectful.

## Contributions

All new features and bug fixes should be submitted as pull requests, so the community can review and discuss them. Core Team members can commit directly to the repository for very small changes, but should generally also submit new code as a pull request.

When you submit a pull request, `@mention` a few people you’d like to help you review it. Once those people have signed off on it, the pull request can be merged! Core Team members will handle the merge itself.

## Coding Standards

If you aren't sure how a feature should be implemented, we recommend checking out our <i>standards document</i>, which outlines every aspect of writing framework features, from `Sass` to `JavaScript`.

## Becoming a Codenauts

Want to join our crack team of Codenauts? The Core Team is inviting active community members to become Codenauts on a case-by-case basis. If you want to become a contributor, engage the community on our Forum, help us close issues on GitHub, and review pull requests from other contributors.

If you’ve made substantial contributions to a MolGL® framework and haven’t heard from us yet, you can reach out at services@sequomics.com.

Contributors are expected to:

- Engage the community on GitHub by responding to and tagging issues.
- Write pull requests to address bugs and feature requests.
- Help in reviewing pull requests from users, contributors, and the Core Team.
- Follow the guidelines outlined in this document.

Here are some example contributions from some of our awesome team members:

- Jonas Jörenberg - converted our Sass unit tests to a newer test runner called True.
- Andy Cochran - reworked the CSS for button groups to fix issues with stacking and border radii.
- Herman Chernoff - developed the Database Schema and updated the MySQL.
